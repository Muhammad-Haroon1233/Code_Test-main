 Code Refactor

1. Removed redundant comments.
2. Grouped methods based on CRUD actions for better readability.
3. Adjusted variable names for clarity.

TestCases:

	 testCreateorUpdate:

   		 - `testCreateOrUpdateWithValidData`: This test case checks if the method works correctly with valid input data for the translator role.
    	 - `testCreateOrUpdateWithInvalidRole`: This test case checks if the method returns false when an invalid role is provided.

	willExpireAt :
    
		assertTrue is used to check if the result is equal to the expected value.
		The second argument of assertTrue provides a message for better clarity in case the assertion fails.
		These tests cover various scenarios of the willExpireAt method and use assertTrue to validate that the calculated results match the expected values.
